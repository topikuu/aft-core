Building and Installing
=======================

Home Page
---------
The project is hosted on the website of the Intel Open Source Technology
Center, 01.org :  http://01.org/AFT
Note: this package is not intended to be installed directly, rather it
should be pulled in as dependency from other components.


Premise
-------
The SW has been tested with OpenSUSE 13.2 64 bits.
Other distros should work equally well, since the code is 100% python, but
they are not confirmed.
For example, some issues might arise with the packaging, when using Other
distros still based on rpms, because they might have different naming and/or
breakdown of the dependency.


Configuring and installing from rpm repository
----------------------------------------------
To use the ready-made packages, add and enable the rpm repo:

Alternatively, on non-rpm distros, it is possible to install by using directly
the setup.py file in the root directory of the repo.
